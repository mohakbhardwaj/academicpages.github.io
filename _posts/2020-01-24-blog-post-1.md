# Setting up mujoco-py and OpenAI Gym on Amazon AWS

I am roughly following the steps from [here](https://github.com/reinforcement-learning-kr/pg_travel/wiki/Installing-Mujoco-py-on-Linux)

1. Select the Deep Learning Base AMI and launch an EC2 instance.
2. SSH into your instance
3. Install Anaconda and create conda environment with python=3.7
4. Install pip with get_pip.py
5. For -lGL error, follow steps from [here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)
   - First install sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3
   - If still doesn't work, manually maker the symbolic link as such sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so
   - If link already exists, remove the current one and make again.
