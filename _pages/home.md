I am Mohak Bhardwaj, currently a Robotics Engineer at <a href="http://www.nearearth.aero/">Near Earth Autonomy,Inc</a> working on  motion planning for real-world UAVs. Previously, I worked as an Extern at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-area/air-lab/">The Air Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">The Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/">Dr. Sebastian Scherer</a> on the applying reinforcement and imitation learning to robot motion planning. I graduated my M.S in Robotic Systems Development from RI in 2016 where I was working on planning for ground vehicles. I completed my B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi.

Research Interests
======
<p align="justify">
My research interests lie in the application of statistical machine learning techniques to enable long-term decision making in autonomous robots. My current research deals with creating motion planning algorithms that can adapt to the environment and the robot capabilities using novel combinations of model-free reinforcement learning(RL) and imitation learning with model-based planning. I am interested in further exploring such methods. I am also interested in questions on safe training of RL agents by leveraging policy and/or model uncertainty for better exploration and robustness. Another area of research that I wish to probe is to prevent reward hacking in RL by using extra rewards or policies as heuristics that guide the learning/planning without altering final learnt behavior.

This is a video of the invited long talk I gave at Conference on Robot Learning(CoRL), 2017 on my work on [Learning Heuristic Search via Imitation](https://mohakbhardwaj.github.io/SaIL/) which aligns most closely to my research interests.
