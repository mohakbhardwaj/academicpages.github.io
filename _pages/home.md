I am Mohak Bhardwaj, currently a Robotics Engineer at <a href="http://www.nearearth.aero/">Near Earth Autonomy,Inc</a> working on  motion planning for real-world UAVs. Previously, I worked as an Extern at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-area/air-lab/">The Air Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">The Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/">Dr. Sebastian Scherer</a> on the applying reinforcement and imitation learning to robot motion planning. I graduated my M.S in Robotic Systems Development from RI in 2016 where I was working on planning for ground vehicles. I completed my B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi.

Research Interests
======
<p align="justify">
Broadly, I am interested in machine learning and motion planning for autonomous robots. I am particularly excited about creating robots that can operate consistently for long amounts of time in complex environments. To this end, I am interested in the application of statistical techniques to create algorithms that can reason over long horizons, improve their performance from experience and adapt to changing data distributions and capabilities of the robot. I am also interested in ensuring safe operation by incorporating the robot's policy or model uncertainty into planning.

This is a video of the invited long talk I gave at Conference on Robot Learning(CoRL), 2017 on my work on [Learning Heuristic Search via Imitation](https://mohakbhardwaj.github.io/SaIL/) which aligns closely to my research interests.
